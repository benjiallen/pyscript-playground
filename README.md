# Playing with PyScript

I'm trying to learn [PyScript](https://pyscript.net/). My first project is an [accessible](https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/) org chart. The org chart is deployed using GitHub pages. See the [org chart demo](https://benjiallen.github.io/pyscript-playground/org-chart.html).

The data used in the org chart is based on names and GitHub handles of [cpython contributors](https://github.com/python/cpython/graphs/contributors). The manager relationships are completely fictitious.
